    "In today's job market, data is everything. Companies, recruiters, and business analysts constantly ask questions like: What skills are most in-demand right now? Which job titles pay the highest? How is the remote work market growing? These questions cannot be answered through guesswork—they require real data collected systematically from job boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project teaches you how to collect that data ethically and legally. Remote OK is one of the largest job boards for remote work positions, with thousands of job postings updated daily. By scraping this data responsibly, you will understand how real companies and data professionals extract market intelligence without breaking laws or harming the platforms they use."
